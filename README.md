# Python-Project-1

Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook(s) used for analysis. The notebooks include data exploration, visualizations, and any modeling or experiments performed for the project.

Primary language: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

## Repository structure

- *.ipynb — Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis.
- (Optional) requirements.txt — Python package requirements, if present.
- (Optional) data/ — data files used by notebooks (not included by default; add as needed).

If the repo contains multiple notebooks, consider adding a short summary of each notebook here (purpose, input files, and expected outputs).

## Getting started (local)

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Josweks/Python-Project-1.git
   cd Python-Project-1

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv venv
   # macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Install dependencies:

   If there's a requirements.txt:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

   Otherwise, common packages for notebooks:
     pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

4. Start Jupyter:

   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab

Open the .ipynb files in your browser and run cells in order.

## Run in Google Colab or Binder (optional)

- Google Colab: upload the notebook to Colab or open via "Open with > Colab" if you host the notebook raw URL.
- Binder: you can add a Binder badge if you add an environment file (requirements.txt, environment.yml, or Dockerfile).

Example Binder badge:

## Data

If notebooks rely on external data, include instructions here on where to place data files (e.g., data/ directory) and whether any files are excluded via .gitignore.

## Notebooks

(Optional) Provide a list and short description of notebooks, e.g.:

- analysis.ipynb — Exploratory data analysis and plots.
- model_training.ipynb — Model training and evaluation.
- eda.ipynb — Initial data cleaning and EDA.

If you want, I can auto-generate this list by scanning the repository and summarizing each notebook.
